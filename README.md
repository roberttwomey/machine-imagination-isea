# Description

An introduction for writers, theater makers, and performers to co-writing with generative AI. This hands-on workshop with GPT culminates in a live, collectively co-authored radio show performance and broadcast. We extend the textual generation from previous Radio Plays with the addition of speech synthesis and performative AI.
